# GalterDataLab Scripts

This is a place to keep scripts created for researchers who consult the Galter DataLab and DataClinic as well as code related to internal research and publications.

There is another repository for DataLab workshop materials [here](https://github.com/galterdatalab/galterdatalab.github.io).
